Why does this repo exist?

Well [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) has changed the way theming works by having you include a gem, which is great if you want to use a published theme for styling but a bit annoying if you want to style your own pages. As such here is the structure of a Jekyll site prior to gem theming convention.
